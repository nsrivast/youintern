Dear <%= @username %>,

We'd like to thank <%= @company_name %> for supporting YouIntern.com over the last few months and for posting your internships. After speaking with our employers, we've learned that many of you have hired fantastic young talent after using YouIntern.com, but you've had lots of suggestions. We've listened to your feedback and worked hard through the summer to make numerous changes to YouIntern.com.  And it is all available now at www.YouIntern.com.  YouIntern 2.0.  Considerably improved.

Employers can now:
- Post internships for free
- Upgrade posts to be regionally targeted ($10/month) or featured posts ($25/month).
- Manage the ENTIRE internship process directly on YouIntern.com.  You can store all applications, resumes, and contact information right in your Portfolio.  No more paper resumes!
- Engage thousands of students who are visiting our website
- Navigate our more user-friendly design

Your account is still active at the new YouIntern.com. For security reasons, we'd like you to reset your password. Please follow this link: http://new.youintern.com/welcome/change_password and enter the following information:

	username: <%= @username %>
	temporary password: <%= @new_pass %>

We'll say this clearly: employers are our focus.  Your internships drive student participation, and in these tough economic times, young, eager talent is more willing than ever to commit unpaid time to your internships.

Reach out to these students.  Only at YouIntern.com.
