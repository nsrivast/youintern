Dear <%= @username %>,

As a longtime user, you've seen YouIntern evolve drastically over the last few months.  We've been working night and day to provide something even better for you, and now, we're immensely pleased to share the new YouIntern.com.  We think you'll find that our hard work will make everything easier for you.
 
We've engaged even more companies to provide richer internship experiences for you -- the core users of our site.  Our search function is vastly improved, so you can search for internships, employers, or internship reviews much more efficiently.  And now, you can create a small profile and upload your resume so that you can apply for new internships directly on YouIntern.com.  Soon, employers will be able to offer YOU internships!
 
Everything is free for students.  That's part of our mission - to bring interns and employers together to create a more educational internship culture.
