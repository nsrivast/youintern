## About YouIntern ##

This is the codebase for a rails website I personally built and maintained from 2007-2009, as the sole 
technical partner at YouIntern. YouIntern was an online community for interns, connecting students looking
for work and employers looking for help. We matched employer-submitted internships with student-submitted 
internship reviews, in addition to providing networking opportunities and career advice for students looking 
for internships.

As the recession took its toll on the US economy in 2009, employers had no trouble finding qualified 
interns, and the site was forced to wind down. 

I worked in a partnership with [Dan Chaparian] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/danchaparian) and [Anand 
Chopra-McGowan] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/achopramcgowan/). Graphic design work (logos, styelsheets)
was done by [Matt Donovan] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattddonovan).

give a good sense of the design and functionality of the site.

YouIntern gathered more than 125k unique visitors over the 2 years of its operation, with 6000 students
and 550 employers at its peak.
